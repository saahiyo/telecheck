/**
 * The `bubble` theme: the same fourteen cues, made of water. Playful and
 * opt-in: an app switches to it with `setTheme`, or uses it for one moment with
 * `play()`'s `theme` option or `data-cuelume-theme`.
 *
 * Every cue is its own gesture, and one sound: a knock for tap and type, a drip
 * for select, a cork for toggle, a balloon for open, a gulp for close, and so
 * on. The only theme whose tones slide. Nothing
 * is centred above 5 kHz, outcomes say what they mean in one glide (success rises,
 * error sinks, warning stays level, attention bends up), and levels match the
 * default palette on the loudest 30 ms.
 *
 * Arranged for emphasis like the other themes: layers marked from "normal"
 * are ornament that subtle leaves out, and each cue has a layer only strong
 * plays.
