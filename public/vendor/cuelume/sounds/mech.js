/**
 * The `mech` theme: the same fourteen cues in a dry, precise, mechanical
 * material. Machined parts rather than glass, wood, and air. No room, no
 * ring beyond a struck part's own, and nothing harsh, industrial,
 * retro-computer, or sci-fi.
 *
 * Level-matched to the default palette on momentary loudness (the loudest
 * 30 ms), so switching themes changes the material, not the volume.
 *
 * Arranged for emphasis like the default palette: layers marked from
 * "normal" are ornament that subtle leaves out, and each cue has a layer only
 * strong plays.
